  There are some hard-hitting dinosaurs here, but it's mostly easier than the previous set.
  Be aware of the wall traps on these floors.

  Welcome to Behemoth's Domain!
  Lots of easy mobs in the first half, but the last few floors can get rough.
  Try to conserve poms as much as possible,
    but don't be afraid to blow a flight if you're short on time,
    or a raging if you get a floor with a lot of Anzus and Sasquatches, bad debuffs, etc.
  Make sure to pop raising immediately, assuming you either have 3 or are not confident in your ability to clear the set.
  This is the last set where they drop too.
  Be aware of the wall traps on these floors.
PotD181: |
  Don't forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot be found here, unfortunately.
  This is the scariest set in terms of the regular floors.
  187-189 have absolutely terrible mobs that you mostly won't want to fight solo.
  186 can be bad too, but is a bit more random in the enemies you'll see.
  The usual plan is to get as far as you can with minimal pomander usage,
    and then use what you need to get through the last few floors.
  Alterations are great here - if you get mandragoras, great!
  If you get mimics, they're still much better than most of the other enemies.
  Rage is great, and there are a couple optimal ways to use it
  Use fortune and clear the entire floor (or as much as possible), then go back to collect your loot.
  Even better if you planned ahead and used affluence as well.
  Double-rage - collect as many chests as you can and locate the exit before-hand, then use rage.
  Clear enemies close to the exit as quickly as possible and go into the portal with rage still active.
  You can then continue killing a few enemies on the next floor before it wears off.
  Flights are not great here as they don't combine well with alteration,
    and don't save you much time with rage either since the enemies are more spread out.
  Flight will save more time on the earlier floors that you're going to fight through if you need it.
  Be aware of the wall traps on these floors.

  Almost there! Time to stop playing conservatively and use everything you've got!
  Go in with a plan based on what pomanders you have.
  Always use raising immediately if you have it.
  More do not drop in this set unfortunately
  Use fortunes/affluences early if you need pomanders
  Most enemies die in 2-3 hits from resolution
  Generally best used on the late floors,
    but consider using on early floors if there are a lot of corse patrols,
    as avoiding them can be very time-consuming
  Note which enemies are immune to stun,
    as you'll probably be taking hits from them while getting your second/third shots off. Consider using steel
  Use witching first to make this a little safer. Just be careful with imps still
  The early floor mobs are easiest, so best to save flights and rages for mid or late floors
  Don't forget to use up your safties and sights
  Be aware of the wall traps on these floors.
