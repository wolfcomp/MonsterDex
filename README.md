# DeepDungeonDex

A plugin for [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) that displays live data for targeted mobs in Final Fantasy XIV's Deep Dungeons.

Data is hardcoded into the plugin and is curated from multiple sources, the most prominent of which are my own testing and Maygi's resources for [Palace of the Dead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oV_SIs5L9kD_NHO2ZsU4Tw8R6iQ4v1RC5fZPQqK6cD8/view) and [Heaven-on-High](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YVBSTOgJO-xOAB6YyKZEZRikjXFPle6Ihf_E7VdmQnI/view).

Plugin is very much a work in progress, with a lot of data (especially for PotD) incorrect or untested. I am striving to have my plugin be the most accurate resource on Deep Dungeon there is, so please open a GitHub issue to report suggestions or to add or correct missing or incorrect data!
